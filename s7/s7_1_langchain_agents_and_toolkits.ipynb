      "Summary: Michel de Nostredame (December 1503 – July 1566), usually Latinised as Nostradamus, was a French astrologer, apothecary, physician, and reputed seer, who is best known for his book Les Prophéties (published in 1555), a collection of 942 poetic quatrains allegedly predicting future events.\n",
      "Nostradamus's father's family had originally been Jewish, but had converted to Catholic Christianity a generation before Nostradamus was born. He studied at the University of Avignon, but was forced to leave after just over a year when the university closed due to an outbreak of the plague. He worked as an apothecary for several years before entering the University of Montpellier, hoping to earn a doctorate, but was almost immediately expelled after his work as an apothecary (a manual trade forbidden by university statutes) was discovered. He first married in 1531, but his wife and two children died in 1534 during another plague outbreak. He fought alongside doctors against the plague before remarrying to Anne Ponsarde, with whom he had six children. He wrote an almanac for 1550 and, as a result of its success, continued writing them for future years as he began working as an astrologer for various wealthy patrons. Catherine de' Medici became one of his foremost supporters. His Les Prophéties, published in 1555, relied heavily on historical and literary precedent, and initially received mixed reception. He suffered from severe gout toward the end of his life, which eventually developed into edema. He died on 1 or 2 July 1566. Many popular authors have retold apocryphal legends about his life.\n",
      "In the years since the publication of his Les Prophéties, Nostradamus has attracted many supporters, who, along with some of the popular press, credit him with having accurately predicted many major world events. Academic sources reject the notion that Nostradamus had any genuine supernatural prophetic abilities and maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are the result of (sometimes deliberate) misinterpretations or mistranslations. These academics also argue that Nostradamus's predictions are characteristically vague, meaning they could be applied to virtually anything, and are useless for determining whether their author had any real prophetic powers.\n",

      "Summary: Nostradamus is the sixteenth studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, focusing on the 16th-century writer Nostradamus. It is a double album and the band's first concept album. It was originally intended to be released in late 2006 before being pushed back to a 2007 release, and was finally released on 17 June 2008 on Epic Records.

      "Summary: Chiren, also spelled Chyren and named as Selin and Seline, is a person who appears in the predictions of Nostradamus. Chiren would be a European, presumably from France, or a Hindu from India. The arrival of this person would coincide with a great war bringing several decades of suffering and several decades of peace. A man with a black frizzy beard would be an enemy of Chiren. According to Nostradamus, Chiren would eventually reign as a world leader and ensure long-lasting world peace.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know the final answer\n",
      "Final Answer: Nostradamus is known for his book Les Prophéties, which is a collection of 942 poetic quatrains allegedly predicting future events. He is also known for the figure of Chiren, who is said to bring about a great war and eventually reign as a world leader and ensure long-lasting world peace.\u001b[0m\n",
